Honestly there werent many major issues I ran into. The main one was layering the like button on top of the image in the gallery. I fixed it by putting both elemends inside of a div, then setting the main images position to relative. When I set the like button's position to absoloute, it sets the position based on the relative postion of its (nearest) ancestor; the image. 

Parts of my work were guided by W3Schools and CSS Tricks but all code is original/heavily edited.
